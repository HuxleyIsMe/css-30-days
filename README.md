# CSS focussed and only projects 

Hello this is a my lil css playground

To have a look run 

`npm install` 

then 

`npm run build-storybook`

then 

`npm run storybook`


### notes 

this repo is years old and packages need updating also its a playground for me, things are not high fidelity.

This is also not using storybook fully i am aware :)
